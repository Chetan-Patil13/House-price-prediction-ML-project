# 🚀 Machine Learning Regression Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on solving a **real-world regression problem** using machine learning. The dataset is preprocessed, multiple models are trained, and the best model is selected based on performance metrics. The final model is then saved for future predictions.

## 📂 Dataset Description
- **Data Type:** Structured tabular data
- **Target Variable:** Continuous numerical value
- **Features:** Multiple independent variables affecting the target variable
- **Source:** Publicly available dataset with real-world relevance

## 🏗 Methodology
### **1️⃣ Data Understanding & Preprocessing**
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔ Handling missing values  
✔ Outlier detection and treatment  
✔ Feature scaling & encoding  
✔ Feature engineering  

### **2️⃣ Model Selection & Training**
✔ Baseline model creation  
✔ Training multiple ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
✔ Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search & Bayesian Optimization  
✔ Cross-validation (k-fold) to improve robustness  

### **3️⃣ Model Evaluation & Interpretation**
✔ Performance metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²  
✔ Residual analysis & error distribution  
✔ SHAP values for explainability  
✔ Feature importance analysis  

### **4️⃣ Prediction & Inferencing**
✔ Making predictions on new data  
✔ Saving and loading trained models  
✔ Formatting predictions for deployment  

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ml-regression-project.git
cd ml-regression-project

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage
```python
# Load the saved model
import joblib
import pandas as pd

model = joblib.load("xgboost_model.pkl")
scaler = joblib.load("scaler.pkl")

# Load new data
new_data = pd.read_csv("new_data.csv")
new_data_transformed = scaler.transform(new_data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data_transformed)
print(predictions)
```

## 📊 Results & Insights
- **Best Model:** XGBoost with R² = 0.93  
- **Feature Importance:** Key driving factors identified using SHAP values  
- **Deployment Ready:** Model saved and can be used for real-world predictions
